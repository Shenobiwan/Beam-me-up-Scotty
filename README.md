# Beam-me-up-Scotty

Hallo,

I like video games and clever apps and hope to make one some day beyond Hello World. I am looking forward to seeing what modern Web Development is like these days as the last time I knew anything about it was before CSS sheets were a thing, and hope my class I'm taking at MSU amounts to more than the classes I've taken myself on codeacademy or linda.com for subjects like java, javascript and 
nodejs, where they skim the surface and tell you your all set to go program stuff after a week. *Fingers crossed* Here's to paying for schooling in the hopes of paying for quality!
